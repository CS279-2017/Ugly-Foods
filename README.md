Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with
a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top
picks. From my experience, **Heroku** is the easiest to get started with, it will
automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, zero-downtime
deployments and custom domain support on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with **mLab** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.

### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku

<img src="http://blog.exadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/heroku-Logo-1.jpg" width="200">
- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `MONGOLAB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.
